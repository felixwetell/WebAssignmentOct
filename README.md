## Portfolio

I'm an all-around programmer, both able to code back-end aswell as front-end. I often code in C# on the back-end side and I have some knownledge about SQL and database structuring. Front-end side, I usually code HTML5, CSS3 and only some JavaScript. I have now learned C# and I do have some knownledge in Java too. During my time (2 years) when programming I have used git to sync and work togheter with small teams. The git client I'm most familiar with is Github.
